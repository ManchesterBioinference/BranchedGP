# E203, W503 and E501 conflict with black
# E741 suggests that "l" is not a good variable name. Whilst true, it's not obvious what other name would be better.
#   To be revisited.
# E402 is about imports not being at the top of the file. For notebooks we want to relax this requirement.
# E302 is about how many blank lines you should have between statements. It's acceptable to relax this for notebooks.
